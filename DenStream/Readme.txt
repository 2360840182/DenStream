DATA:
This directory has saved the data that you can use for this program.
The directory "/DATA" saves the data file ,and I have generated three sets of data.
The directory "/DataGenerate" saves the program that you can change the parameter sigma to generate more
data.Even you can revise the DotGenerate to change the shape and distribution of these clusters.Generally 
speaking,a big parameter sigma may result in low precision,so you should choose a appropriate sigma.I 
think that sigma between 0.1 to 2 may be a good choice.When you want to generate data,you just need to 
execute the program PointEntrance(sigma);
